# AI Rules for edu-quiz

EduQuizAI is an educational application designed for creating and conducting quizzes, primarily at the school level.
The system enables the generation of interactive quizzes with AI support. 
The application distinguishes between two user roles: an administrator who manages quizzes and accounts, 
and a student who browses, launches, and completes quizzes, receiving immediate feedback on answer correctness.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 (Core frontend framework)
- Tailwind 4 (Primary styling solution)
- Shadcn/ui (React component library)
- Python + FastAPI (Core backend framework) + unicorn (ASGI server)
- Database Stack: SQLAlchemy + SQLite

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
