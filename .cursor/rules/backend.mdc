## Guidelines for Python

- Use snake_case for variable and function names. 
- Use CamelCase for class names. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines. 
- Include type hints for function parameters and return types. 
- Write docstrings for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods.
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation with strict type checking and custom validators
- Implement dependency injection for services and database sessions to improve testability and resource management

- Use path operation decorators consistently with appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, etc.)
